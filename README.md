> **🎨 Design the AI that powers your products collaboratively at [zv1.ai](https://zv1.ai) and bring it to production with our open-source SDKs**

Welcome to the zv1 open-source monorepo! This repository contains the execution engines, node libraries, and tools that power ZeroWidth's collaborative AI design platform. Think Figma for AI - design, align on, and orchestrate the AI behaviors that will power your next-generation products and services at [zv1.ai](https://zv1.ai), then execute them anywhere via our API, using these open-source SDKs, or by having zv1 act as the design spec for any framework of choice.

## 🎯 What is zv1?

zv1 is a collaborative platform for designing and aligning on AI behavior before production. Rather than another workflow automation tool, zv1 enables teams to work together in shared workspaces to design, test, and refine the AI orchestrations that will become the intelligent core of their products and services. Create custom collections of prompt libraries, evaluators, and specialized agents - all nestable and configurable without code.

### Key Features

- **👥 Collaborative Workspaces**: Teams design AI behavior together in shared environments
- **🎨 Visual AI Design**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for complex AI orchestrations
- **🤖 180+ AI Models**: Native support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, DeepSeek, and more
- **📚 Design Systems for AI**: Custom collections, prompt libraries, nestable agents, and reusable components
- **🔬 Built-in Evaluation**: Test and validate AI behavior before production deployment
- **🚀 Production Ready**: Deploy via API/SDK or use as design specs for any framework
- **🔐 Secure by Design**: API keys and sensitive data stay in your environment
- **📊 Full Observability**: Monitor costs, performance, and AI behavior in real-time

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

This monorepo is organized to support multiple programming languages while sharing common node definitions and types:

### Core Components

#### 🎯 Nodes (`/nodes`)
The building blocks of AI orchestration. Each node is a self-contained component for designing intelligent systems:

- **AI Models**: 180+ LLM integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, DeepSeek, etc.)
- **Prompt Engineering**: Dynamic prompts, templates, and context management
- **Data Processing**: Arrays, strings, JSON, CSV, mathematical operations
- **I/O Operations**: Input/output handling, file operations, HTTP requests
- **Logic & Control**: Conditionals, loops, error handling, testing utilities
- **Evaluation & Testing**: Model comparison, quality scoring, A/B testing

#### 📝 Types (`/types`)
Shared type definitions and schemas that ensure consistency across all SDKs.

#### 🚀 SDKs (`/sdks`)
Language-specific execution engines that interpret and run zv1 AI orchestrations:

- **Node.js** (`/sdks/nodejs`) - ✅ Available now
- **Python** - 🚧 Coming soon
- **C#** - 🚧 Coming soon  
- **Go** - 🚧 Coming soon

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Design Your AI Orchestration
Visit [zv1.ai](https://zv1.ai) to collaborate on AI design with your team:

1. **Sign up** at [zv1.ai](https://zv1.ai) (free tier available)
2. **Create workspaces** for your team and projects
3. **Build collections** of prompts, agents, and evaluators
4. **Design AI flows** using drag-and-drop visual interface
5. **Test & evaluate** AI behavior with built-in tools
6. **Export** your orchestration as a `.zv1` JSON file or use via API

### 2. Execute Locally

#### Node.js
```bash
npm install zv1
```

```javascript
import zv1 from 'zv1';

// Load your AI orchestration designed at zv1.ai
const engine = await zv1.create('./myflow.zv1', {
  keys: {
    openrouter: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY
  }
});

// Execute your AI behavior in production
const result = await engine.run({
  chat: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello, world!' }]
});

console.log(result.outputs);
```

For complete documentation, see the [Node.js SDK README](sdks/nodejs/README.md).

## 🎨 Example AI Orchestrations

### Simple AI Agent
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "input1",
      "type": "input-chat",
      "settings": { "key": "messages" }
    },
    {
      "id": "ai1", 
      "type": "anthropic-claude-3-5-sonnet",
      "settings": { "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant." }
    },
    {
      "id": "output1",
      "type": "output-chat"
    }
  ],
  "links": [
    { "from": { "node_id": "input1", "port_name": "messages" },
      "to": { "node_id": "ai1", "port_name": "messages" } },
    { "from": { "node_id": "ai1", "port_name": "response" },
      "to": { "node_id": "output1", "port_name": "messages" } }
  ]
}
```

### Data Processing Pipeline
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "csv1",
      "type": "csv-parser",
      "settings": { "has_headers": true }
    },
    {
      "id": "filter1",
      "type": "array-filter",
      "settings": { "condition": "item.age > 18" }
    },
    {
      "id": "api1",
      "type": "http-request", 
      "settings": { "method": "POST", "url": "https://api.example.com/process" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🛠️ Development & Contributing

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zerowidth/zv1.git
   cd zv1
   ```

2. **Sync shared assets** (only needed for development)
   ```bash
   python scripts/sync_sdks.py
   ```
   This copies the shared `/nodes` and `/types` directories to each SDK.

3. **Work on specific SDKs**
   ```bash
   cd sdks/nodejs
   npm install
   npm test
   ```

### Repository Architecture

The monorepo uses a **shared core, distributed execution** model:

- **Shared Assets**: Node definitions and type schemas in `/nodes` and `/types`
- **Sync Script**: `sync_sdks.py` distributes shared assets to language-specific SDKs
- **Independent SDKs**: Each SDK can be developed, tested, and released independently
- **Consistent API**: All SDKs implement the same core execution interface

### Adding New Nodes

1. Create node directory in `/nodes/your-node-name/`
2. Add configuration: `your-node-name.config.json`
3. Implement processing logic in target languages:
   - `your-node-name.js` (Node.js)
   - `your-node-name.py` (Python - coming soon)
4. Add tests: `your-node-name.tests.json`
5. Sync to SDKs using one of these methods:

   **Option A: One-time sync**
   ```bash
   python scripts/sync_sdks.py
   ```

   **Option B: Auto-sync during development (recommended)**
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   npm install
   npm run dev  # Watches for changes and auto-syncs
   ```

   The auto-sync watcher monitors `/nodes`, `/types`, and `/tests` directories and automatically copies relevant files to language-specific SDKs in real-time.
